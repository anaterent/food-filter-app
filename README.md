Food filter app ⊹₊｡ꕤ˚₊⊹
Designed to import saved places data from Google Maps via an API that doesn't exist yet to let the user filter places using search, single and multiple selections.
For now, it uses hardcoded data to show the simple filtering functionality.
Note: toggle filter is unfinished and should really just be deleted.
